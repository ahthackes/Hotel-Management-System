# Hotel Management System (SQL Project) 🏨

## Introduction
This is my semester project for the Database Systems course at Riphah International University. It is a complete database designed to manage hotel operations.

## Features
* **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server.
* **Key Concepts Used:**
    * Complex Queries & Joins
    * Stored Procedures (for automation)
    * Database Triggers
    * Views for reporting
    * Normalized Tables (3NF)

## How to Run
1.  Download the `Hotel_Management.sql` file.
2.  Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
3.  Run the script to create the database and tables.

## Future Improvements
I plan to connect this database with a Python front-end for a full GUI experience.
